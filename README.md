This is the project repository for our app. We used firebase for hosting, which means that all of the relevant html/css/js files are located in subfolders of the `public` folder. Site images are under `/public/images`, and favicons are under `/public/images`. The `/upload_firestore` folder contains all of the csv and json files which are the initial data for our database, along with the scripts to upload them to firebase.

To setup the development environment, first install a few programs:
    1.<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
    2.<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a>
    3.<a href="https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/">Selenium IDE</a>
    
Afterwards, create a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase account</a> to be able to access the database.
