            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <article>
                It is not a secret that Vancouver is a city of biking, yet some of the infrastruture to support it has seemingly been left untouched. 
                Although we have pay and go bike rentals, we still have to call in to book a locker, or be at the parkade to check for availability. These factors, along with a high bike theft rate, has turned Vancouver into the city with the 
                <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-still-has-the-most-bike-thefts-per-capita-among-major-canadian-cities-despite-efforts-1.5898575">Highest Bike Theft per Capita</a>
                among major Canadian cities.
                <br>
                <br>
                With safe storage being such a pressing concern, Vikings all started with the simple question of "why can't I reserve my bike locker online?".
                <br>
                <br>
                After the idea was born, four developers came together to tackle this problem.
                Once we began, more questions arose. 
                <br>
                <br>
                "What are the popular routes?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "Where can I find an air pump?"
                <br>
                <br>
                We realized that Vikings could be so much more than a reservation app.
                We wanted to create something that every biker could use, something that would reduce the time and energy spent on
                these questions.
                <br>
                <br>
                As bikers ourselves, we relish the feeling of traversing a beautiful route, or the relief of knowing that the next air pump is 5 minutes away.
                Our dream is to create more of these moments, to transform the biking experience into one that is stress-free so that you
                can focus on the scenary.
                <br>
                <br>
                Vancouver is also a city that is focused on staying on the leading edge of urban sustainability and combating climate change, and we want to contribute to that target.
                According to <a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/greenest-city-action-plan-development.aspx">Vancouver's Greenest City Action Plan</a>, and one of the City's goals is related to <a href="https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/green-transportation.aspx">Green Transportation</a>. 
                The target is for over 50% of trips to be by foot, bike, and transit by 2020, and 75% by 2040. By making it easier to start biking, Vikings can help to create a more eco-friendly community.

            <h1>Meet the Vikings!</h1>
            <article>The mutual cooperation when issues arise on the road.
                <br>
                The perseverance to make it over the next hill.
                <br>
                The respect for each other's skill, fitness, and space.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you've ever biked with a group, then you'll be familiar with their importance.
                These values also represent the four bikers who came together to form the Vikings team. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Vikings are cooperative; we are quick to assist difficulties so nobody is left behind.
                Vikings persevere; we go above and beyond in ensuring that the task is completed without delay.
                Vikings are respectful; everyone's opinion is heard and considered.
                Most of all, we are a team that celebrates each other's achievements; the success of one is
                the success of all.</article>
